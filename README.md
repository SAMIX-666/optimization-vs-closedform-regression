#optimization-vs-closedform-regression
This repository implements linear regression on the Boston Housing Dataset using two methods:

Closed-form solution (Normal Equation)

Vectorized method (Gradient Descent)

Results:
Both methods showed similar accuracy in terms of RÂ² and MSE, indicating that they are implemented correctly.
However, the closed-form solution is slower and less efficient for large datasets, while the vectorized method is more scalable and works better for larger datasets.
